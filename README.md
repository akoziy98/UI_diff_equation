This is repository with two versions of UI for differential equation solving, provided by streamlit and Voila packages.

Here was solved the equation of oscillator:

Equation: 

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%20y%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D%20%3D%20-%20%5Comega%5E2%20y%28t%29%20-%20%5Cbeta%20y%5E3%28t%29)

Conditions: $y(0)=q$, $\frac{dy(0)}{dt} = r$
