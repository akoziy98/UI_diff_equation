# UI_diff_equation
This is repository with two versions of UI for differential equation solving, provided by streamlit and Voila packages.

Here was solved the equation of oscillator:

## Voila

to run UI with Voila you need to open your console and run the next command:

```
voila .\UI_diff_eq_voila.ipynb
```

## Streamlit

to run UI with streamlit you need to open your console and run the next command:

```
streamlit run .\UI_diff_eq_streamlit.py
```
